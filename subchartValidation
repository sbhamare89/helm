Yes, it is possible to perform subchart installation validation inside the main chart itself. Helm provides a mechanism called hooks that allow you to perform actions before or after certain events during the chart's lifecycle.

You can leverage Helm hooks to execute validation steps for each subchart before installing the main chart. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. Create a `templates` directory inside your main chart if it doesn't already exist.

2. Create a new file in the `templates` directory, let's call it `subchart-validation.yaml`.

3. In `subchart-validation.yaml`, define a Kubernetes Job that performs the validation for a specific subchart. You can use a container image with the necessary tools and commands to validate the subchart.

4. Use the `pre-install` or `pre-upgrade` hook in the main chart's `Chart.yaml` file to execute the validation job before installing or upgrading the chart. Here's an example of how it can be done:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v2
   name: my-main-chart
   version: 1.0.0
   hooks:
     pre-install: |
       {{- include "my-main-chart.subchart-validation" . }}
     pre-upgrade: |
       {{- include "my-main-chart.subchart-validation" . }}
   ```

5. In your main chart's `templates` directory, create a new file called `_helpers.tpl` (if it doesn't exist already).

6. In `_helpers.tpl`, define a template that includes the `subchart-validation.yaml` for each subchart:

   ```yaml
   {{- define "my-main-chart.subchart-validation" -}}
   {{- range .Values.subcharts }}
   {{- include (printf "%s.subchart-validation" .name) . }}
   {{- end }}
   {{- end }}
   ```

7. For each subchart, create a template file in the `templates` directory that matches the name used in the `subchart-validation.yaml`. For example, if you have a subchart named `my-subchart`, create a file called `my-subchart.subchart-validation.yaml`.

8. In each `my-subchart.subchart-validation.yaml` template file, define a Kubernetes Job that performs the validation for that specific subchart.

9. When you install or upgrade the main chart using Helm, the validation jobs for each subchart will be executed before the main chart installation process. If any of the validation jobs fail, the installation or upgrade process will be aborted.

By including subchart validation as part of the main chart's hooks, you can ensure that all the subcharts are validated before the main chart is installed. This approach allows you to encapsulate the validation process within the main chart itself, making it more convenient to manage and deploy.
